# Terminal Group Chat Application in C

This is originally me following the tutorial of [STUDevLantern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEiur5aZnIM) in learning about Network Programming in C. 
However I thought the subject was pretty fun so I decided to add more to this project. 

## Additions Made
1. Entry and Exit Signals
2. Signal Protocol (on [the Standards file](Standards.md))
